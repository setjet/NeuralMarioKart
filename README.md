# NeuralMarioKart
A set of scripts to record a dataset of actions and pixels fetched from a nintendo 64 emulator, which are then used to train a neural network that is able to play mariokart.


A brief test run example of a completely autonomous run:

TODO: 
add references, refactor, upload sample, add description, update model (reduce overfit: dropout/reg/early stop/smaller model, diversify validation set more), and video of neural network in action

Inspired by initial Kevin Hughes's implementation, but significantly improved neuralnet architecture
