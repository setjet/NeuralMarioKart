# NeuralMarioKart
A neural network that is able to play mariokart with pure pixels as input, and xbox controller actions as output.

TODO: 
add references, refactor, upload sample, add description, update model (reduce overfit: dropout/reg/early stop/smaller model, diversify validation set more)

Inspired by initial Kevin Hughes's implementation, but significantly improved neuralnet architecture
